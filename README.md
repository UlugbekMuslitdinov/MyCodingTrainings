# Coding Trainings Repo
Welcome to the Coding Trainings Repo, a repository where I store my pet projects, practice files, and learning exercises for various technologies, including Flutter, Java, Machine Learning (ML), and files from The Odin Project.

## Flutter Projects
In this section, you will find various Flutter projects I have developed to enhance my skills in mobile app development. Each project is organized in its own directory and comes with a README providing information and instructions for running the app.

## Java Projects
In the Java Projects section, you can explore different Java-based applications and exercises that I've worked on to deepen my knowledge of Java programming. Each project has its own directory and includes a README with details on how to run the Java applications.

## Machine Learning (ML) Projects
In the Machine Learning Projects section, you will find a collection of ML projects that I have undertaken to expand my understanding of machine learning algorithms and their practical applications. Each project has a dedicated directory and is accompanied by a README explaining the project's purpose, dataset sources, and instructions for running the ML models.

## The Odin Project Practice Files
As part of my journey with The Odin Project, I have stored my practice files and exercises in this section. The Odin Project provides hands-on web development training, and here, you can find my solutions to the various coding challenges and assignments.
